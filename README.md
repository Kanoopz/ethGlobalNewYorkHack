"./axerLane crossChain accountAbstraction Unification", for short: "./chainAbstractionUnification".

****IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION WAS BUILD FROM SCRATCH, IT DIDNT USE ANYTHING FROM THE PAST ETH GLOBAL SUPERHACK "/chainAbstraction" PROJECT REPO.

chainAbstractionUnification project aims to; 
    1: Solve the erc4337 fragmentation problem due to the lack of an actual standard of abstractedAccounts/smartAccounts by linking the different abstractedAccounts (AA) through any     evmCompatible chains, causing that an actual "standard" is not needed anymore thanks to this unified infraestructure.
    2: Improve the UX of the average blockchain/cyrpto user by managing assets accross all evmChains in a single chain with an abstractedAccount, making possible that the user doesnt have to actually change networks when interacting with a different chain dApp or asset.
    3: Enable the payment of gas accross all evmChains by using a single evmChainNativeAsset for operations/orders/transactions all over the evmCompatibleChains ecosystem.
        Example: pay the gas of transactions on base, optimism, ethereumMainnet, linea, arbitrum, etc with matic, so the user only has the need to hold that nativeAsset(matic).
